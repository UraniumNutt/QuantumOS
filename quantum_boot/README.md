# Quantum Boot
This is a implementation for a custom bootloader written in `rust`, `C`, and `asm`. 
This is mostly a learning experience and also to make my kernel exactly how I want it
to function. This is also to get over the fear that I had about writing my own bootloader
and this is partly to get over that fear!
