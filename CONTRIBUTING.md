# Guidelines for Contributing to Quantum

Although Quantum might be small, we firmly believe in maintaining a set of guidelines that govern its contributions.

## Respect in Commits and Towards Contributors

A very common, but undesirable scenario is when an individual submits a new Pull Request, only to be met with rudeness. There is a fine distinction between offering constructive criticism and disparaging someone. We understand that some contributors might unintentionally generate code that is suboptimal, or even potentially harmful. However, their contribution is with the intent to improve the project. As such, we encourage pointing out areas for improvement in their code constructively and helpfully, rather than outrightly labelling it as 'bad'. This enhances their code's potential to be incorporated into the project while also improving the contributorsâ€™ understanding. 

However, it should be noted that suboptimal code will not be automatically accepted into the project. We firmly believe that contributing to open-source projects should not instill fear or cause friction among developers, particularly those who are new to contributing. Meeting the project's standards is still a prerequisite for a Pull Request to be accepted.

## What Constitutes an Acceptable Commit?

An acceptable commit is one that is detailed and outlines the changes made, along with their significance. This is crucial to allow those who review your commit to understand how your changes contribute to the project as a whole. Given that one cannot intuit your thought process, much like how one cannot read your mind, it is necessary to provide sufficient details for others to comprehend your rationale.

## Perfection in Numbers

Should you overlook a minor detail, or if a bug is discovered while your contribution is under review, rest assured that we will notify you in a courteous and respectful manner. Not everyone has the ability to foresee or identify all potential problems that could arise from any given solution. This is where the beauty of open-source comes into play, as it is a resourceful tool that fosters continuous learning and improvement for all developers that contribute.
